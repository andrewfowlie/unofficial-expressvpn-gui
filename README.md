# What?

A command line program called `xv` and a desktop shortcut that launches a simple graphical user interface to the expressvpn client. You can install it by

    pip install git+https://github.com/andrewfowlie/unofficial-expressvpn-gui.git
    
This installs a command line program called `xv` and a desktop shortcut for convenience. You can find the program by searching `expressvpn` or just `xv` in your application launcher.

# Why?

Because the ExpressVPN browser plugins are broken on snap installed versions of Firefox and Chromium, and since snap is now default in Ubuntu, it's rather annoying.

# Is this in any way official or supported by ExpressVPN?

No.
