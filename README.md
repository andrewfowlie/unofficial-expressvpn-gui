# Install

    pip install git+https://github.com/andrewfowlie/unofficial-expressvpn-gui.git
    
This installs a command line program called xv and a desktop shortcut that launches a simple graphical user interface to the expressvpn client.

# Why?

Because the ExpressVPN browser plugins are broken on snap installed versions of Firefox and Chromium, and since snap is now default in Ubuntu, it's rather annoying.
